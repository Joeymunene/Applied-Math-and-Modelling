This repository contains a simulation of the inverted pendulum, a classic control theory problem that demonstrates balancing an unstable system. 
This serves as a benchmark for testing control algorithms, such as PID control or state-space methods.

Key Features:

Dynamic modeling of the pendulum-cart system
Stabilization control to balance the pendulum upright
Simulation environment for testing different control strategies
