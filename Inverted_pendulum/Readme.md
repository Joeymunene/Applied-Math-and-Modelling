The inverted pendulum is a classic control systems problem used to demonstrate stability and control theory. The system consists of a rigid rod (pendulum) attached to a cart that can move horizontally. 
The pendulum’s center of mass is above its pivot point, making the system naturally unstable. 
The control objective is to apply a force to the cart to keep the pendulum balanced upright while possibly controlling the cart’s position.
