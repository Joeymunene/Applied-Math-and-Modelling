This project simulates stock market price fluctuations using a stochastic model. 
The simulation is based on Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), a widely used model in financial mathematics to describe the random behaviour of asset prices. 
The program generates price paths over time and can be animated to visualize real-time market-like fluctuations.
